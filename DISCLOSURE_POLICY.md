# Responsible Disclosure Policy

Lotus takes security very seriously. We greatly appreciate any and all disclosures of bugs and vulnerabilities that are done in a responsible manner. We will engage responsible disclosures according to this policy and put forth our best effort to fix disclosed vulnerabilities as well as reaching out to numerous node operators to deploy fixes in a timely manner.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

Do not disclose any bug or vulnerability on public forums, message boards, mailing lists, etc. prior to responsibly disclosing to Lotus and giving sufficient time for the issue to be fixed and deployed.
Do not execute on or exploit any vulnerability. This includes testnet, as both mainnet and testnet exploits are effectively public disclosure. Regtest mode may be used to test bugs locally.

## Reporting a Bug or Vulnerability

When reporting a bug or vulnerability, please provide the following to the Lotus maintainers:

* A short summary of the potential impact of the issue (if known).
* Details explaining how to reproduce the issue or how an exploit may be formed.
* Your name (optional). If provided, we will provide credit for disclosure. Otherwise, you will be treated anonymously and your privacy will be respected.
* Your email or other means of contacting you.
* A PGP key/fingerprint for us to provide encrypted responses to your disclosure. If this is not provided, we cannot guarantee that you will receive a response prior to a fix being made and deployed.

## Bounty Payments

Lotus cannot commit to bounty payments ahead of time. However, we will use our best judgment and do intend on rewarding those who provide valuable disclosures (with a strong emphasis on easy to read and reproduce disclosures).

## Security Philosophy

* The security of our users is a top priority
* Fast response to critical issues
* Transparent disclosure once fixes are deployed
* Collaborative approach to security
