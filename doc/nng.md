# NNG Indexer Interface

This allows external indexers to be built efficiently using an easy to use NNG interface.

RPC messages are enabled using `-nngrpc=<url>`, where `<url>` may be:
- `tcp://...` for TCP bind/listen
- `ipc://...` for local named pipe/socket

Available RPC calls currently are:
 - `GetBlockRequest` to get an individual block
 - `GetBlockRangeRequest` to get a range of blocks
 - `GetBlockSliceRequest` to get a slice of a block
 - `GetUndoSliceRequest` to get a slice of the block undo data
 - `GetMempoolRequest` to get the node's mempool
 - `GetMiningTemplateRequest` to fetch a native mining template optimized for external Stratum coordinators
 - `SubmitMinedBlockRequest` to submit a solved block candidate from an external coordinator
 - `ValidateMinedBlockProposalRequest` to pre-validate a candidate without requiring PoW (proposal semantics)
 - `GetMiningStatusRequest` to fetch chain/mempool/high-level mining status fields

The mining RPC additions are designed for external pooled-mining services and
carry both consensus-level payloads (raw block/header bytes) and stratum-
oriented convenience fields (coinbase split, merkle branches, endian-specific
hex fields).
Serialization of the objects transferred and further details are in [nng_interface.fbs](../src/nng_interface/nng_interface.fbs).

Likewise, PubSub messages are enabled using `-nngpub=<url>`, and `-nngpubmsg=<msg>`, where `<msg>` is the message to be enabled (can be supplied more than once) and must be one of:
 - `updateblktip` to notify when the tip moved to a new block hash, after (potentially) a chain of updates. Flatbuffers table is `UpdatedBlockTip`.
 - `mempooltxadd` to notify when a transaction has been added to the mempool. Flatbuffers table is `TransactionAddedToMempool`.
 - `mempooltxrem` to notify when a transaction has been removed from the mempool (e.g. block conflict). Flatbuffers table is `TransactionRemovedFromMempool`.
 - `blkconnected` to notify when a block connected to the chain. Flatbuffers table is `BlockConnected`.
 - `blkdisconctd` to notify when a block disconnected from the chain (e.g. reorg, invalidateblock). Flatbuffers table is `BlockDisconnected`.
 - `chainstflush` to nofity when the block database has been flushed to the disk. Flatbuffers table is `ChainStateFlushed`.

PubSub messages have their message type prepended as the first 12 bytes (0-padded if necessary), after that the message is encoded in the corresponding flatbuffers table (again, see [nng_interface.fbs](../src/nng_interface/nng_interface.fbs)).

## Example

A typical setup for indexers like Chronik would look like, in lotus.conf:

```
nngrpc=ipc://datadir/nngrpc.pipe
nngpub=ipc://datadir/nngpub.pipe
nngpubmsg=blkconnected
nngpubmsg=blkdisconctd
nngpubmsg=mempooltxadd
nngpubmsg=mempooltxrem
```

The same urls would then be specified in the indexer to connect the node to it.

For external stratum services, the exact same transport modes are supported.
In production, use whichever fits your topology:

- `ipc://...` when stratum and lotusd run on the same host and local filesystem
  permissions provide the desired access control boundary.
- `tcp://...` when stratum runs remotely; in this case, explicitly harden bind
  addresses and network policy (firewall allowlists, private networking, etc).
